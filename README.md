# hello-world
This is a generic repository, used to learn and experiment with code.
Currently, I am taking the course, "Data Scientist's Toolbox", on Coursera in order to broaden my data science skills. As an exercise within this course, Github was introduced and it was suggested in one of the exercises to create this repository, with two branches.
